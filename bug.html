This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a class that contains a pseudo-element (like `::before` or `::after`) within a responsive modifier class.  For example, this code will fail to apply the styles correctly:

```html
<div class="md:hover:\:before:bg-red-500"></div>
```

Tailwind will interpret this as an invalid class name because the `::before` pseudo-element is treated differently. It's not a regular class.
